# image-transformations-opencv
“A collection of basic image transformations using OpenCV and Python, including translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing with visual outputs.
# Image Transformations with OpenCV 🖼️

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic **image transformations** using **OpenCV** and **Python**, including:

- 📍 Translation
- 🔁 Rotation
- 📏 Scaling
- ↘️ Vertical Shearing
- ↔️ Horizontal Shearing

Each transformation is applied to a sample image and visualized using **Matplotlib** to better understand the effect of affine transformations.
